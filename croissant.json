  "name": "Realized Expressivity Graph Datasets Focused on Positional and Structural Encodings and Rewiring",
  "description": "Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are central to machine learning on graphs, but their limited expressivity constrains their ability to capture complex graph structures. To enhance MPNN expressivity, practitioners often employ positional and structural encodings and rewiring methods---collectively referred to here as graph transformations (GTs). However, the expressivity of GTs remains poorly understood, in part due to difficulty analyzing them with the Weisfeiler-Leman hierarchy. Moreover, there is a substantial gap between the expressivity that models achieve in theory and what they realize in practice---a discrepancy to which GTs significantly contribute due to their opaque influence on information propagation. This dataset addresses this gap. We extend the BREC benchmark suite [Wang and Zhang, 2024] with novel datasets tailored to GTs, and introduce a modified loss function for fair evaluation. We use the benchmark to systematically evaluate popular GTs, revealing distinct strengths and trade-offs that inform future model design.",
